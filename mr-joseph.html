                <p>During Mr Ozuruigbo Joseph’s stay in police custody he found out that officers were holding
                    lesbians/gay in detention without charge
                    Mr Joseph Ozuruigbo helped some of them escape when we found out that there punishments was death by
                    hanging because is prohibited in Nigeria Mr Joseph Ozuruigbo paid off offices to let the lesbians/
                    gay escaping there oppression In police custody
                    Before Mr Joseph Ozuruigbo left the country he got the information from one of the lesbian/gay he
                    helped escape the police ,that a lesbian/gay couple (Miss Cynthia Okoro and Miss Sandra Jude )was
                    arrested
                    Because the got married in imo state Nigeria and being held without trial
