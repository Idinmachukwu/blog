        <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8EE3PjR9-Og">Police brutality has been at the crux of the #EndSARS
            protests. A year after the Lekki tollgate shooting, the conduct of the #Nigerianpolice and other security
            forces has continued to be a cause for concern for many Nigerians. For some at the Lekki Tollgate Memorial
            Car Procession, that concern became a life-altering reality. ARISE Correspondent Adefemi Akinsanya was on
            the ground at the Lekki tollgate. Not only did she and the team witness police abuse, but they also
            experienced first hand just how heavy-handed the police can be.</a></p>
